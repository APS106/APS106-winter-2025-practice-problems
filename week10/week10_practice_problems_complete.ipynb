    "One method of estimating $\\pi$ is to use Monte Carlo simulation as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place a circle with radius, $r$, inside a square with sides of length $2r$. The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$ and the area of the square is $(2r)^2$. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the square is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. If you randomly choose $n$ points inside the square, approximately $\\frac{n\\cdot \\pi}{4}$ of them will be inside the circle. So by counting the number of points inside the square but outside the circle compared to the number of points inside both the square and the circle, you can estimate $\\pi$: let $m$ be the number of points inside the circle. $\\pi$ can then be estimated as $\\frac{4\\cdot m}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that estimates $\\pi$ by randomly picking points inside the square and testing if they are inside the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you should create an object-oriented program with three classes:\n",
    "* `Point`\n",
    "* `Square` (implemented using `Point`)\n",
    "* `Circle` (also implemented using `Point` – how?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the estimate, `Square` should have a method called `generate_random_point` that returns a random `Point` inside the `Square`. `Circle` should have a method called `check_inside` which takes a Point and returns `True`/`False` depending on whether the point is inside the `Circle` or not.
