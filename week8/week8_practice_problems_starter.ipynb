Write a program that randomly assigns values between 0 and `max_value` to a `size`-by-`size` matrix. **The matrix should be represetned as a nested tuple (i.e. a tuple of tuples).** Print the matrix to the screen, and then calculate the sum of values around the \"outside\" (border) of the matrix: that is, the sum of the entries in the first and last rows and first and last columns but without double counting the corner entries. For example, if the random matrix is:\n",

If it is the first half, then look at the middle element of the first half (i.e., a quarter of the way through the initial array) and decide if the element is in the first quarter or second quarter. If it is in the second half, look at the middle element of the second half (i.e. three-quarters of the way through the original array) to decide if you should like in the third quarter or fourth quarter. Then look halfway again, and halfway again, and … \n",

    "A sparse vector is a one whose entries are almost all zero, e.g., `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`. To save memory, such sparse vectors can be stored as a dictionary that just keeps the non-zero entries. For example, the vector above could be represented as `{0:1, 6:3}`: the value 1 at index 0 and the value 3 at index 6.\n",
    "1. Write a function called `sparsify` that takes in a list of integers and returns a dictionary representing a sparse vector.\n",
    "2. The sum of two vectors is the element-wise sum of their elements. For example, the sum of `[9, 9, 9]` and `[1, 2, 3]` is `[10, 11, 12]`. Write a function called `sparse_add` that takes two sparse vectors stored as dictionaries and returns a new dictionary representing their sum.\n",
    "3. The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of corresponding elements. For example, the dot product of `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` is 4+10+18, or 32. Write a function called sparse_dot that calculates the dot product of two sparse vectors.\n",

    "Depending on how you implemented the method above, the resulted sparse vector may end up containing an entry for a zero element, because -2 + 2 = 0. To fix this problem, let's write a function that takes in a sparse vector and remove zero element entries, if any.\n",
    "5. As an alternative to 4, re-write your `sparse_add` function to always return a valid sparse vector (i.e. does not contain an entry for a zero element).\n"

Since you need to count the number of occurrences of each letter in the word (let's say there are n letters), that means count will make n \"steps\"  n times (i.e., you will look for each letter (n steps) once for each letter (n letters)). So your program will execute n2 steps. See if you can write the solution without using `count()` such that you only look at each letter in the word once (or twice) not n times. \n",
