    "Create a class named `DecimalConvert`. The object should have an attribute  called `decimal`.  Then, write a class method (call it `convert`) to convert the positive base-10 integer (the `decimal` attribute) to binary. The class method should return a string of 0s and 1s corresponding to the binary value of the value of the integer. You may have to do a bit of research to figure out how to convert a base-10 to integer to binary. The class method should just retrun `None` if the input is not a positive integer.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to buy a house, you need to find houses that are for sale. The multiple listing service (MLS) is a real estate listings service in Toronto that is updated throughout the day with new listings. The service has limited capabilities with housing listed by district, rather than particular streets. It would be much more convenient for the user to be able to input a list of streets and see all the houses for sale on those streets. You goal is to take the current listings and create such an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have basic MLS real estate data in a CSV file called `real_estate.csv`. Write an algorithm that does the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Enter a street name (type exit when done): wells\n",
    "    Enter a street name (type exit when done): perth\n",
    "    Enter a street name (type exit when done): exit\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Houses on wells\n",
    "    No houses on wells\n",
    "    Houses on perth\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Address: 436 perth Size: 900 Price: $ 479900\n",
    "    Address: 115 perth Size: 1100 Price: $ 699900\n",
    "    Address: 516 perth Size: 800 Price: $ 498900\n",

    "    Address: 179 perth Size: 1100 Price: $ 699000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you want the user to input a number of street names and you should print out the information on available houses on each street.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very high-level Algorithm Plan could be the following:\n",
    "* Read in the data and store it somehow\n",
    "* Get the user input and store it somehow\n",
    "* For each street entered, find houses on the street\n",
    "* Print-out the address, size, and price of each house found\n",
    "\n",
    "You should try to write your algo in two ways:\n",
    "* Store the real estate data in a list.\n",
    "* Store the real estate data in a dictionary where the key is the street name and the value is a list of the data for each house."
