    "The box score of a hockey game is the number of goals each team scores in each period followed by the total number of goals. We are going to represent the box score from one game in a list as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [[\"MTL\", [1,0,0,1]], [\"TOR\", [1,0,1,2]], \"TOR\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "The box score contains 3 entries: two lists and a string. \n",
    "* The first and second entries (both lists) have the same form: a string and a list of 4 integers. The string is the team name and the list is the goals scored by that team in the first, second, and third periods and then the goal total. \n",
    "* The last entry is a string with the name of the team that won. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume that there is no overtime and no ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of box scores (that is a list where each element is a box score in the form defined above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a single box score and returns `True` if the box score is well-formed under the following rules:\n",
    "* The goals for each team sum up to the total number of goals scored by the team in the box score.\n",
    "* The team that is listed as winning, scored the most goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "If either of the above is not true, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your function by creating a list of at least 3 box scores, with at least one of each type of error and calling the function for each box score. Be careful to exactly follow the rules for the form of the box scores. Here is a list of box scores in Python format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    box_scores = [[[\"MTL\", [1, 0, 0, 1]], [\"TOR\", [1,0,1,2]], \"TOR\"],\n",
    "                  [[\"VAN\", [1, 2, 0, 3]], [\"CGY\", [1,1,0,4]], \"CGY\"],\n",
    "                  [[\"EDM\", [18, 0, 0, 18]], [\"OTT\", [0,0,0,0]], \"EDM\"]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus Questions: \n",
    "1. Extend the format of the box scores and your code to deal with overtime and shoot-outs. Under current NHL rules, there are no ties. You might consider adding to your checking function to make sure that there are no overtime goals if one team is ahead after regulation time and that there are no shoot-out goals if one team is ahead after regulation time or overtime. And that there can only be one goal for either team in the overtime or shoot-out.\n",
    "2. Write a new function that takes a list of box scores and a team name and calculates the number of points that the team has earned. A team gets 2 points for a win and 1 point for an overtime or shoot-out loss. (No points for a loss in regulation time).\n",
    "3. Adapt the problem to check the equivalent of box scores for your favorite sport: football, baseball, tennis, cricket, … (but maybe cricket will be too complicated?).\n",
