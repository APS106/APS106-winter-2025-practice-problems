    "1. Extend the format of the box scores and your code to deal with overtime and shoot-outs. Under current NHL rules, there are no ties. You might consider adding to your checking function to make sure that there are no overtime goals if one team is ahead after regulation time and that there are no shoot-out goals if one team is ahead after regulation time or overtime. And that there can only be one goal for either team in the overtime or shoot-out.\n",
    "2. Write a new function that takes a list of box scores and a team name and calculates the number of points that the team has earned. A team gets 2 points for a win and 1 point for an overtime or shoot-out loss. (No points for a loss in regulation time).\n",
    "3. Adapt the problem to check the equivalent of box scores for your favorite sport: football, baseball, tennis, cricket, â€¦ (but maybe cricket will be too complicated?).\n",
